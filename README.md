CS50 Final Project - LoyalT

Video demonstration: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iHQQfEDr6ko&ab_channel=MichaelT

For this project, I created a website that allows companies to set up and manage loyalty rewards programs 100% digitally without having to use loyalty 
rewards cards. To get set up a company would create an account and then create a new rewards program.

When creating a new rewards program the business enters the program name, the number of purchases needed to win a reward, and what the reward is. An example could
be Tim Hortons creating a program where after every 7 purchases the customer is rewarded a free cup of coffee. 

Once a program is created the company can enter all the customers associated with that program. The business then must enter the customer's email and purchase 
amount every time a sale is made. The website will track how many purchases are associated with each customer and will let the business know when a customer has 
won a reward.

The website also comes with sales analytics to track the perfomance of the business's rewards programs.
